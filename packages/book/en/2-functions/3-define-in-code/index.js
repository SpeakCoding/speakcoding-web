                <b>Round brackets</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Functions are coded differently across various programming languages. Nonetheless,
                they can be identified in code by a common characteristic, namely their round
                brackets ().
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Function title</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The brackets always appear after the function title, making them easy to locate
                within the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Keyword "func"</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                In many programming languages, the keyword "func" is written before the function
                title.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Inputs, classes</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Appearing after the function title (in its round brackets), and separated by commas,
                is a listing of the inputs and their classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Sequence of actions</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Appearing after the round brackets are rows that determine the sequence of actions;
                these are generally easy to identify within the code:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In most programming languages, these rows appear in curly brackets {'{ }'} that
                    close immediately after the round brackets close.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In some programming languages, a colon appears after the closing round bracket,
                    and the action sequence is defined on a new, indented line.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Relation to a class</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                A <Term id='function'>function</Term> typically relates to a specific{' '}
                <Term id='class'>class</Term> (for example, the â€˜edit post caption function relates
                to the Post class). Therefore, a <Term id='function'>function</Term> should be
                written in the same place where its <Term id='class'>class</Term> is defined.
            </p>

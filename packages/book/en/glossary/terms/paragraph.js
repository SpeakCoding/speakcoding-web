        several consecutive ‘statements’ in code that share a common context can be selected and put
        into a ‘paragraph’. Paragraphs are typically enclosed in curly brackets {}. Each new line
        within a paragraph is indented using the Tab key. All variables created within the context
        of a paragraph cease to exist when the paragraph is closed (after which they can no longer
        be used in the code).

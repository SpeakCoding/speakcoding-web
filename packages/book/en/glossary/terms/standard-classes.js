        classes that don’t require definitions, for example: string (text string); int
        (integer)/uint (unsigned, cannot be negative); float (character with a fractional part after
        the punctuator); and byte (unit of information). It is worth memorizing these (though they
        can be Googled). We don’t need to run the creation function to create new instances of these
        classes; instead, we can write the corresponding values directly into the code.

        a quality or property that distinguishes a particular class. For example, letâ€™s assume that
        we have a green book: its color is one of its characteristics. The Book class has the Color
        property. When defining classes in code, their properties are written in the same way as
        their components. So, when compiling the definition of a book, we present this as the Book
        having a component called Color that belongs to the Color class.
